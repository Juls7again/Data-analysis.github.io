							<p>
								In this project, our primary objective is to build a binomial logistic regression model and evaluate the
									 model's performance.s to demostrate knowledge of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a binomial logistic
									  regression model.	</p>

							<h3 class="major">Conclusion:</h3>
							<p> 1. activity_days was by far the most important feature in the model. It had a negative correlation with user churn.
								 This was not surprising, as this variable was very strongly correlated with driving_days, which was known from EDA 
								 to have a negative correlation with churn.</p>
							<p>2. User churn rate increased as the values in km_per_driving_day increased. The correlation heatmap here in this 
								notebook revealed this variable to have the strongest positive correlation with churn of any of the predictor 
								variables by a relatively large margin. In the model, it was the second-least-important variable.</p>
							<p>3. In a multiple logistic regression model, features can interact with each other and these interactions can 
								result in seemingly counterintuitive relationships. This is both a strength and a weakness of predictive models, 
								as capturing these interactions typically makes a model more predictive while at the same time making the model 
								more difficult to explain.</p>
							<p>4. In the case of this model, one of the engineered features (professional_driver) was the third-most-predictive 
								predictor. It could also be helpful to scale the predictor variables, and/or to reconstruct the model with different 
								combinations of predictor variables to reduce noise from unpredictive features.</p>
