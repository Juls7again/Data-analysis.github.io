								<p>
									In this project, our primary objective is to conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis, 
									encompassing data cleaning and the creation of visual plots to elucidate variables and their relationships.	</p>

							<h3 class="major">Conclusion:</h3>
							<p>1. Nearly all the variables were either very right-skewed or uniformly distributed. For the right-skewed 
								distributions, this means that most users had values in the lower end of the range for that variable. For
								 the uniform distributions, this means that users were generally equally likely to have values anywhere 
								 within the range for that variable.</p>
							<p>2. Most of the data was not problematic, and there was no indication that any single variable was completely 
								wrong. However, several variables had highly improbable or perhaps even impossible outlying values, such as 
								driven_km_drives. Some of the monthly variables also might be problematic, such as activity_days and driving_days, 
								because one has a max value of 31 while the other has a max value of 30, indicating that data collection might not 
								have occurred in the same month for both of these variables.</p>
							<p>3. Less than 18% of users churned, and ~82% were retained.</p>
							<p>4. The farther a user drove on each driving day, the more likely they were to churn. On the other hand, number of 
								driving days had a negative correlation with churn. Users who drove more days of the last month were less likely to churn.</p>
							<p>5. Users of all tenures from brand new to ~10 years were relatively evenly represented in the data. This is borne out by 
								the histogram for n_days_after_onboarding, which reveals a uniform distribution for this variable.</p>
