							<h1 class="major">Python || Multiple linear regression: Historical marketing promotion data</h1>
							<span><img src="images/binds.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></span>
							
							

							<p>Multiple linear regression helps you estimate the linear relationship between one continuous dependent variable and 
								two or more independent variables. For data science professionals, this is a useful skill because it allows you to 
								compare more than one variable to the variable you're measuring against. This provides the opportunity for much more 
								thorough and flexible analysis.</p>
							<p>In this project will be analyzing a small business' historical marketing promotion data. Each row corresponds to an 
								independent marketing promotion where their business uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions to 
								increase sales.</p>
							<p>	To address the business' request, I will conduct a multiple linear regression analysis to estimate sales from a combination 
								of independent variables. This will include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Exploring and cleaning data
									</li>
								<li>Using plots and descriptive statistics to select the independent variables
									</li>
								<li>Creating a fitting multiple linear regression model
									</li>
								<l1>Checking model assumptions
									</l1>
								<li>Interpreting model outputs and communicating the results to non-technical stakeholders</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Familiarize with the data's features</h2>

							<ul>
							<li>TV promotional budget (in "Low," "Medium," and "High" categories)</li>
							<li>Social media promotional budget (in millions of dollars)</li>
							<li>Radio promotional budget (in millions of dollars)</li>
							<li>Sales (in millions of dollars)</li>
							<li>Influencer size (in "Mega," "Macro," "Micro," and "Nano" categories)</li>
							</ul>

							</ul>
							<h2>Conclusions</h2>			
								<ol>
									<li>TV was selected, as the preceding analysis showed a strong relationship between the TV promotional budget and the average Sales.
										</li>
									<li>Radio was selected because the pairplot showed a strong linear relationship between Radio and Sales.
										</li>
									<li>Social Media was not selected because it did not increase model performance and it was later determined to be correlated with another independent variable: Radio.
										</li>
									<li>Influencer was not selected because it did not show a strong relationship to Sales in the preceding analysis.</li>
									<li>Fitting multiple linear regression models may require trial and error to select variables that fit an accurate model while maintaining model assumptions.
										</li>
									<li> According to the model, high TV promotional budgets result in significantly more sales than medium and low TV promotional budgets. Thus, it is recommended that the business allot a high promotional budget to TV when possible and invest in radio promotions to increase sales.</li>
